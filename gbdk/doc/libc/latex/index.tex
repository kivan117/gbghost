 The following pages document a good size chunk of the libraries that go along with gbdk. They were automatically generated from the header files using {\tt doxygen libc.dox}

Thanks to quang for many of the comments to the gb functions. Some of the comments are ripped directly from the Linux Programmers manual, and some directly from the pan/k00Pa document.
