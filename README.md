# gbghost
Ghosty Ghost port/rewrite for the original Gameboy (DMG)
Check out the original at https://github.com/kivan117/gghost

Created with Visual Studio Code on Windows 10. This project uses the GBDK library to write the game in C.
Makefile and batch file included. You'll need to edit directory variables.
If using Windows, you'll also need make for Windows.
Emulators used for testing were BGB and Sameboy.
No work has been done to clean up the repo or do a proper ignore file yet, it needs it badly.
